# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jaylen, or simply Jay, and I'm a cybersecurity student and programmer from the United States who's interested in pretty much anything to do with technology and birds. I started programming back in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when a few of my friends introduced me to Python, and ever since I've been hooked. My main language at the moment is Python, however, I have recently started learning Go and I have found it interesting to work with, with plans to try to learn other languages such as Rust, Nim, and (maybe) more. You can reach out to me by sending an email to <a href="mailto:jay@jaylenr.org">jay@jaylenr.org</a> or any of my online accounts listed [here](https://jaylenr.org/accounts).
