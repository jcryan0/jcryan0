# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jaylen, or simply Jay, and I'm a cybersecurity student and programmer from the United States who's interested in pretty much anything to do with technology and birds. I started programming back in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when a few of my friends introduced me to Python, and ever since I've been hooked. My main language at the moment is Python, however, I have recently started learning Go and I have found it interesting to work with, with plans to try to learn other languages such as Rust, Nim, and (maybe) more.
